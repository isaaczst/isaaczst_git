# Abstract
	- Here, we present the design of a novel unpowered ankle exoskeleton that is low profile, lightweight, quiet, and low cost to manufacture, intrinsically adapts to different walking speeds, and does not restrict non-sagittal joint motion; while still providing assistive ankle torque that can reduce demands on the biological calf musculature. 
	  - 在这里，我们展示了一种新型无动力踝关节外骨骼的设计，该外骨骼外形小巧、重量轻、安静且制造成本低，本质上适应不同的步行速度，并且不限制非矢状关节运动； 同时仍然提供辅助踝关节扭矩，可以减少对生物小腿肌肉组织的需求。
	- This paper is an extension of the previously-successful ankle exoskeleton concept by Collins, Wiggin and Sawicki.
	  - 这篇论文是 Collins、Wiggin 和 Sawicki 先前成功的踝关节外骨骼概念的延伸。
	- We created a device that blends the torque assistance of the prior exoskeleton with the form-factor benefits of clothing. 
	  - 我们创造了一种设备，将先前外骨骼的扭矩辅助与服装的外形优势相结合。
	- Our design integrates a [[low profile]] under-the-foot **clutch** and a soft **conformal** **shank** interface, coupled by an ankle assistance spring that operates in parallel with the user's **calf **muscles.
	  - 我们的设计集成了一个低调的脚下离合器和一个柔软的**保形**小腿接口，再加上一个脚踝辅助弹簧，与用户的小腿肌肉平行运行。
	- We fabricated and characterized technical performance of a prototype through benchtop testing and then validated device functionality in two gait analysis case studies.
	  - 我们通过台式测试制造并表征了原型的技术性能，然后在两个步态分析案例研究中验证了设备功能。
	- To our knowledge, this is the first ankle plantarflexion assistance exoskeleton that could be feasibly worn under typical daily clothing, without restricting ankle motion, and without components protruding substantially from the shoe, leg, waist, or back.
	  - 据我们所知，这是第一款可以穿在典型日常服装下的踝关节跖屈辅助外骨骼，不会限制踝关节运动，也没有从鞋子、腿部、腰部或背部大量突出的组件。
	- Our new design highlights the potential for performance-enhancing exoskeletons that are inexpensive, unobtrusive, and can be used on a wide scale to benefit a broad range of individuals throughout society, such as the elderly, individuals with impaired plantarflexor muscle strength, or recreational users.

	- In summary, this paper demonstrates how an unpowered ankle exoskeleton could be redesigned to more seamlessly integrate into daily life, while still providing performance benefits for common locomotion tasks.
