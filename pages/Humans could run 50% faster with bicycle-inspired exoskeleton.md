- **Runners could soon keep up with cyclists**, thanks to a new invention from a team of mechanical engineers at Vanderbilt.
- The invention, an exoskeleton worn on the legs, would **bring cycling mechanics to the human body** and enable people to run nearly 1.5 times as fast — approaching top cycling speeds. The study with the device, “How to run 50 percent faster without external energy,” appears in Science Advances.
- “While bicycles rely on human energy the same as running, cycling is faster because of the energy-efficient processes engaged while on a bike,” explained David Braun, assistant professor of mechanical engineering and lead on the study. “Our lab took those processes and sought a way to more effectively augment human performance.”
- ==Components of energy conservation== while on a bike include the rolling motion of the wheels, which avoids energy losses that occur when runners step, the body weight support provided by the bike rather than by the legs, and the energy supplied through continuous pedaling rather than momentary stepping.
  - 骑自行车时节能的组成部分包括车轮的滚动运动，以避免跑步者踩踏时发生的能量损失，自行车而不是腿提供的体重支撑，以及通过连续踩踏而不是瞬间提供的能量 踏步。
- The theoretical exoskeleton device propels the user forward with energy stored in the spring.
-
- To leverage the continuous motion of bike pedaling, Braun and graduate student Amanda Sutrisno designed the theoretical exoskeleton device to allow the legs to supply energy while in mid-air. 
  - 为了利用自行车踏板的连续运动，Braun 和研究生 Amanda Sutrisno 设计了理论上的外骨骼装置，让腿在半空中提供能量。
- They realized that a device, strapped in parallel to each leg and housing a robotic spring, could achieve the same technological advances as a bicycle.
- Here’s how it works: During a stride, the device springs compress and release in time with the motion of the legs, allowing one spring to contract when the leg pulls up into the air and the other to extend as it comes into contact with the ground.
  - 它的工作原理是这样的：在跨步过程中，该装置的弹簧会随着腿的运动而及时压缩和释放，从而使一个弹簧在腿伸向空中时收缩，另一个在与地面接触时伸展 .
- Existing devices with springs, such as jumping stilts, reduce the energy losses when runners step, but do not support the body or allow the legs to move the body forward while in the air, somewhat similar to a bicycle without a seat and a pedal. 
  - 现有的带有弹簧的装置，例如高跷，可以减少跑步者跨步时的能量损失，但在空中不支撑身体或让腿部向前移动身体，有点类似于没有座椅和踏板的自行车。
  The new exoskeleton device could not only support the body but also allow the legs to provide energy in the air, so runners can also use all their leg power as when pedaling the bicycle to accelerate — meaning they can run faster than ever.
  - 新的外骨骼装置不仅可以支撑身体，还可以让腿在空中提供能量，因此跑步者也可以像踩自行车一样使用所有腿部力量来加速——这意味着他们可以跑得比以往任何时候都快。
- “We’ve invented a way to overcome the fundamental limitation for running that energy is only being expended during the short ground contact times at each step,” explained Braun. 
  - 布劳恩解释说：“我们发明了一种方法来克服跑步的基本限制，即能量仅在每一步的短时间接触地面时消耗。”
  “The invention will not only present a technological advancement for runners, but possibly a third kind of augmentation device competitive to bicycles and ice skates.”
- As technologies improve and concerns about “technological doping” in sporting events crop up, Vanderbilt researchers believe the device’s significant advantage and novel mechanics could one day lead to an entirely new sport. 
  - 随着技术的进步和对体育赛事中“技术兴奋剂”的担忧出现，范德比尔特大学的研究人员认为，该设备的显着优势和新颖的机制有朝一日可能会导致一项全新的运动。
